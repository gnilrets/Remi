# scratch

This directory is intended to be used to hold code in active development/testing.
The workflow is to modify one of these file and load it in irb.  I'm going to
keep them here in source control while I'm still in the very early stages of
development and still hashing out ideas.  But later, it should be removed
and added to .gitignore.
